Data Analysis project using SQL, Excel, R programming, Tableau, Power BI tools.
Data Set : https://www.kaggle.com/rahulyadav0710/netflix-and-disney/data?select=netflix_titles.csv
Data set contains information about Netflix's movies and TV shows for almonst 130 countries since 1993. Data is in dimension form and demands data cleaning and data validation before proceeding with analysis.
I have tried to clean data using Excel and R and I would recomend to try R programming language for data cleaning which offers effective method/functions to clean the data in quick and effective way.
